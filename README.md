# cogandmem
Cogandmem (short for Cognition and Memory) is a Python package for running memory experiments. It relies heavily on Pygame, a Python package generally used for creating video games. Cogandmem can be used to present stimuli (currently supports single words, word pairs, and images), display instructions to the screen, collect input from the keyboard (e.g., subjects typing their responses to a free-recall test), and play Tetromino (a Tetris clone) as a distractor task. At present, free and cued recall are supported, with plans to add old/new and forced-choice recognition in the near future.
